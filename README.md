# Oracle Engine

Oracle Engine is [Foundry](https://d2foundry.gg)'s Rust and WebAssembly based Destiny 2 calculation API, originally forked from the [D2 Calculation API](https://github.com/D2-Insight/D2_Calculation_API). This repo is what holds the weapon formulas, stat calculations, perk info, etc. that we use to display on Foundry.
